[SFML][] is a library written in C++, so *CrSFML* also needs to ship thin [C bindings to SFML](#the-c-wrapper).\n\nTo quote the official site of SFML,\n\n> SFML provides a simple interface to the various components of your PC, to ease the development of games and multimedia applications.\n\nIndeed, SFML is most often used to make video games. It provides features such as hardware-accelerated 2D graphics, handling keyboard, mouse and gamepad input, vector and matrix manipulation, managing windows (can also be used as a base for OpenGL drawing), working with multiple image formats, audio playback and recording, basic networking... Check out some [demos] of *CrSFML* to see what it can do.\n\n*CrSFML* consists almost entirely of automatically generated code, based on SFML's header files. Read more about [generated code](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [API differences between SFML and CrSFML](#api-differences-between-sfml-and-crsfml).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFirst, [install SFML](#install-sfml).\n\nThen create a _shard.yml_ file in your project's folder (or add to it) with the following contents:\n\n```yaml\nname: awesome-game\nversion: 0.1.0\n\ndependencies:\n  crsfml:\n    github: oprypin/crsfml\n    version: ~> 2.5.1\n```\n\nResolve dependencies with [Shards][]:\n\n```bash\nshards install\n```\n\nDuring installation this will invoke `make` to build the C++ wrappers as object files. If that fails, see [Custom SFML location](#custom-sfml-location).\n\nTry running an example:\n\n```bash\ncp lib/crsfml/examples/snakes.cr .\ncrystal snakes.cr\n```\n\nNow you're ready for the **[tutorials]**!\n\n##### Windows\n\nCrystal does not officially support Windows, but CrSFML supports it and is perfectly usable already. See [a video detailing the full setup][windows-setup].\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe C++ wrappers require a C++ compiler (C++03 will do).\n\n#### Install SFML\n\n[SFML][] must be installed, with the version that matches `SFML_VERSION` in [src/version.cr](src/version.cr) (usually latest). If it doesn't, no need to look for an older release of *CrSFML*, just [re-generate the sources](#generating-sources) for your version. SFML versions 2.3.x through 2.5.x are supported by *CrSFML*.\n\nThere are detailed [official instructions][sfml-install] on how to install SFML manually, but on many systems there are easier ways.\n\nIf SFML is not installed in a global/default location, see [Custom SFML location](#custom-sfml-location).\n\n##### Linux\n\nMany Linux-based systems provide SFML through their package manager. Make sure to install the *-dev* packages if there is such a separation in your Linux distribution of choice.\n\nNote that most often the packages provided by Linux distributions are outdated. If you're installing an older version of SFML (not recommended), make sure that it's still [supported by *CrSFML*](#install-sfml). You will need to [re-generate the sources](#generating-sources).\n\n##### Mac\n\nThe easiest way to install SFML on macOS is through the [Homebrew][] package manager:\n\n```bash\nbrew update\nbrew install sfml\n```\n\nIt can also be installed by copying binaries, as described in [official instructions][sfml-install].\n\n##### Windows\n\nDownloading [the official binaries][sfml-download] (\"Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 64-bit\") will do. Check out [the video on how to set things up on Windows][windows-setup].\n\n##### From source\n\nBuilding SFML from source is as simple as downloading the source code and running:\n\n```bash\ncmake .\ncmake --build .\nsudo make install  # optional!\n```\n\nIn some cases the dependencies are bundled with SFML, otherwise see the [official build instructions][sfml-build].\n\n### Custom SFML location\n\nIf SFML's headers and libraries are not in a path where the compiler would look by default (and the defaults usually work only on Linux), additional steps are needed.\n\nFirst, before building the extensions (`make`) or generating sources, you need to configure the include path:\n\n```bash\nexport SFML_INCLUDE_DIR=/full/path/to/sfml/include\n```\nWindows equivalent:\n```cmd\nset INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;C:\\path\\to\\sfml\\include\n```\n\nSetting these variables beforehand can also fix `shards install`.\n\nThen, whenever using *CrSFML*, you need to configure the path to SFML libraries so the linker can find them. To apply these for the current shell session, run:\n\n```bash\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/sfml/lib     # Used during linking\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/sfml/lib  # Used when running an executable\n```\nWindows equivalent:\n```cmd\nset LIB=%LIB%;c:\\path\\to\\sfml\\lib\nset PATH=%PATH%;c:\\path\\to\\sfml\\bin\n```\n\nCrSFML's top-level scripts also need the include path to work. E.g. `crystal generate.cr -- /full/path/to/sfml/include`.\n\n### Generating sources\n\nCrSFML's sources come almost entirely from a [generator program](generate.cr). They are based on a particular version of SFML. But as sources for the latest version are already bundled, usually you don't need to do this. [More details](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nAs this is out of scope for [Shards][], let's download the repository separately (then use CrSFML [without Shards](#crsfml-without-shards)).\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml\ncd crsfml\n```\n\nThen we can generate the sources, either directly with `crystal generate.cr` or as part of the build process:\n\n```bash\ntouch generate.cr\nmake\n```\n\nIf run successfully, this generates all the source files and also compiles the C++ wrapper.\n\n### CrSFML without Shards\n\nIt's also possible to use *CrSFML* outside of Shards, as with any library. One option is to directly create a symbolic link to *CrSFML* in your project's *lib* folder.\n\n```bash\nmkdir lib\nln -s /full/path/to/crsfml lib/crsfml\n```\n\nAnother option is to `export CRYSTAL_PATH=/full/path/to` a directory that contains the *crsfml* directory.\n\n\nCrSFML as bindings to SFML\n--------------------------\n\n### API differences between SFML and CrSFML\n\nThe [API of *CrSFML*][api documentation] (a library for Crystal) attempts to be similar to SFML (a C++ library), but some general changes are present:\n\n- Methods are renamed to `snake_case`.\n- Getter, setter methods are changed:\n    - `x.getSomeProperty()` becomes `x.some_property`.\n    - `x.isSomeProperty()`, `x.hasSomeProperty()` become `x.some_property?`.\n    - `x.setSomeProperty(v)` becomes `x.some_property = v`.\n- Structs in Crystal are always passed by copy, so modifying them can be problematic. For example, `my_struct.x = 7` is fine but `array_of_structs[2].x = 5` will not work. To work around this, copy the whole struct, modify it, then write it back. Better yet, avoid the need to modify structs (work with them like with immutable objects).\n- Member functions, such as `loadFromFile`, that are used for initialization, each have a corresponding shorthand class method (`from_file`) that raises `SF::InitError` on failure.\n- SFML sometimes uses *enum* values as bitmasks. You can combine them using the `|` operator.\n- *enum* members are exposed at class level, so instead of `SF::Keyboard::Code::Slash` you can use `SF::Keyboard::Slash`.\n- SFML sometimes requires that an instance must remain alive as long as it is attached to the object. For example, a textured shape will cause errors if the texture object is destroyed. *CrSFML* prevents this problem by keeping a reference to the object.\n- The `Event` *union* and `EventType` *enum* are represented as a class hierarchy. Instead of `ev.type == SF::Event::Resized` use `ev.is_a?(SF::Event::Resized)`; instead of `ev.size.width` use `ev.width`.\n- Instead of subclassing `Drawable`, include the `Drawable` module with an abstract `draw` method.\n- Most of the [API documentation] is taken directly from SFML, so don't be surprised if it talks in C++ terms.\n\n### The C++ wrapper\n\nThe interface of the C++ → C wrapper (which Crystal ultimately binds to) consists entirely of simple functions that accept only native types (such as `float`, `uint32_t`, `char*`) and untyped pointers (`void*`). The untyped pointers are never exposed to the user, only to other auto-generated parts of the code. The function names consist of the original SFML class name, the function name itself, and a base62 hash of the parameter types. Return types are never used; instead, the output is done into a pointer (which is usually the last argument of the function), but, as usual, the memory allocation is the caller's job. The first argument of each function is a pointer to the receiver object (if applicable).\n\nAbstract classes are implemented by exposing a collection of global callback variables, which must be set by the user if they want to use the corresponding class. The callback's first argument is the object, and some arguments are pointers that need to be assigned to inside the callback implementation (because return values are not used).\n\nCompilation of the C++ extensions is based only on SFML's header files, these are made into object files, and all the linking is deferred to the final linker invocation done by Crystal.\n\n#### Why not CSFML?\n\n[CSFML][] is a great library that allows SFML to be used with C. It goes to great lengths to be human-friendly and does a good job of converting C++ idioms to C idioms. In the past *CrSFML* used to be based on it, but after a while it became apparent that the advantages of CSFML's nice interface are also disadvantages when constructing (especially auto-generated) bindings that attempt to look as close to the real SFML as possible.\n\nMany details about functions' signatures are lost, as well as function overloads. Names of data types had to be simplified (not namespaced). And many other such small things that bring the frustration of having to reconstruct the details of the original SFML interface based on the simplified CSFML interface.\n\nThere are many aspects that prevent an efficient implementation from the standpoint of bindings, most importantly, CSFML takes memory allocation into its own hands, so any object creation in *CrSFML* involved allocation of two objects on the heap by two different libraries, and every interaction with it had to go through at least two pointers. Structs in CSFML are actually completely separate data types and they have to be constantly be converted between a \"SFML-struct\" and a \"CSFML-struct\".\n\nInstead of that, the C++ → C wrapper passes the bare SFML data types directly through untyped pointers, and relies on the higher-level binding to deal safely with them. In case of structs the data layout is mirrored, in case of classes the pointers remain completely opaque.\n\nNot to forget that the wrapper is made automatically, so it can be quickly updated to any SFML release and prevents human error that could happen when implementing CSFML.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n*CrSFML* was made by [Oleh Prypin][oprypin].\n\n*CrSFML* is [licensed](LICENSE.md) under the

modes for drawing\n\n`SF::BlendMode` is a struct that represents a blend mode. A blend\nmode determines how the colors of an object you draw are\nmixed with the colors that are already in the buffer.\n\nThe struct is composed of 6 components, each of which has its\nown public member variable:\n* Color Source Factor (*color_src_factor*)\n* Color Destination Factor (*color_dst_factor*)\n* Color Blend Equation (*color_equation*)\n* Alpha Source Factor (*alpha_src_factor*)\n* Alpha Destination Factor (*alpha_dst_factor*)\n* Alpha Blend Equation (*alpha_equation*)\n\nThe source factor specifies how the pixel you are drawing contributes\nto the final color. The destination factor specifies how the pixel\nalready drawn in the buffer contributes to the final color.\n\nThe color channels RGB (red, green, blue; simply referred to as\ncolor) and A (alpha; the transparency) can be treated separately. This\nseparation can be useful for specific blend modes, but most often you\nwon't need it and will simply treat the color as a single unit.\n\nThe blend factors and equations correspond to their OpenGL equivalents.\nIn general, the color of the resulting pixel is calculated according\nto the following formula (*src* is the color of the source pixel, *dst*\nthe color of the destination pixel, the other variables correspond to the\npublic members, with the equations being + or - operators):\n```\ndst.rgb = color_src_factor * src.rgb (color_equation) color_dst_factor * dst.rgb\ndst.a   = alpha_src_factor * src.a   (alpha_equation) alpha_dst_factor * dst.a\n```\nAll factors and colors are represented as floating point numbers between\n0 and 1. Where necessary, the result is clamped to fit in that range.\n\nThe most common blending modes are defined as constants in the SF module:\n`SF::BlendAlpha`, `SF::BlendAdd`, `SF::BlendMultiply`, `SF::BlendNone`.\n\nIn SFML, a blend mode can be specified every time you draw a `SF::Drawable`\nobject to a render target. It is part of the `SF::RenderStates` compound\nthat is passed to the member function `SF::RenderTarget.draw`().\n\n*See also:* `SF::RenderStates`, `SF::RenderTarget`","summary":"<p>Blending modes for drawing</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new(color_source_factor:BlendMode::Factor,color_destination_factor:BlendMode::Factor,color_blend_equation:BlendMode::Equation,alpha_source_factor:BlendMode::Factor,alpha_destination_factor:BlendMode::Factor,alpha_blend_equation:BlendMode::Equation)-class-method","html_id":"new(color_source_factor:BlendMode::Factor,color_destination_factor:BlendMode::Factor,color_blend_equation:BlendMode::Equation,alpha_source_factor:BlendMode::Factor,alpha_destination_factor:BlendMode::Factor,alpha_blend_equation:BlendMode::Equation)-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Construct the blend mode given the factors and equation.\n\n* *color_source_factor* - Specifies how to compute the source factor for the color channels.\n* *color_destination_factor* - Specifies how to compute the destination factor for the color channels.\n* *color_blend_equation* - Specifies how to combine the source and destination colors.\n* *alpha_source_factor* - Specifies how to compute the source factor.\n* *alpha_destination_factor* - Specifies how to compute the destination factor.\n* *alpha_blend_equation* - Specifies how to combine the source and destination alphas.","summary":"<p>Construct the blend mode given the factors and equation.</p>","abstract":false,"args":[{"name":"color_source_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"color_source_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"color_destination_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"color_destination_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"color_blend_equation","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"color_blend_equation","restriction":"BlendMode::Equation"},{"name":"alpha_source_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"alpha_source_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"alpha_destination_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"alpha_destination_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"alpha_blend_equation","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"alpha_blend_equation","restriction":"BlendMode::Equation"}],"args_string":"(color_source_factor : BlendMode::Factor, color_destination_factor : BlendMode::Factor, color_blend_equation : BlendMode::Equation, alpha_source_factor : BlendMode::Factor, alpha_destination_factor : BlendMode::Factor, alpha_blend_equation : BlendMode::Equation)","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/graphics/obj.cr#L135","def":{"name":"new","args":[{"name":"color_source_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"color_source_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"color_destination_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"color_destination_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"color_blend_equation","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"color_blend_equation","restriction":"BlendMode::Equation"},{"name":"alpha_source_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"alpha_source_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"alpha_destination_factor","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"alpha_destination_factor","restriction":"BlendMode::Factor"},{"name":"alpha_blend_equation","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"alpha_blend_equation","restriction":"BlendMode::Equation"}],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"","visibility":"Public","body":"_ = allocate\n_.initialize(color_source_factor, color_destination_factor, color_blend_equation, alpha_source_factor, alpha_destination_factor, alpha_blend_equation)\nif _.responds_to?(:finalize)\n  ::GC.add_finalizer(_)\nend\n_\n"}},{"id":"new(source_factor:BlendMode::Factor,destination_factor:BlendMode::Factor,blend_equation:BlendMode::Equation=Add)-class-method","html_id":"new(source_factor:BlendMode::Factor,destination_factor:BlendMode::Factor,blend_equation:BlendMode::Equation=Add)-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Construct the blend mode given the factors and equation.\n\nThis constructor uses the same factors and equation for both\ncolor and alpha components.

for loading and manipulating character fonts\n\nFonts can be loaded from a file, from memory or from a custom\nstream, and supports the most common types of fonts. See\nthe load_from_file function for the complete list of supported formats.\n\nOnce it is loaded, a `SF::Font` instance provides three\ntypes of information about the font:\n* Global metrics, such as the line spacing\n* Per-glyph metrics, such as bounding box or kerning\n* Pixel representation of glyphs\n\nFonts alone are not very useful: they hold the font data\nbut cannot make anything useful of it. To do so you need to\nuse the `SF::Text` class, which is able to properly output text\nwith several options such as character size, style, color,\nposition, rotation, etc.\nThis separation allows more flexibility and better performances:\nindeed a `SF::Font` is a heavy resource, and any operation on it\nis slow (often too slow for real-time applications). On the other\nside, a `SF::Text` is a lightweight object which can combine the\nglyphs data and metrics of a `SF::Font` to display any text on a\nrender target.\nNote that it is also possible to bind several `SF::Text` instances\nto the same `SF::Font`.\n\nIt is important to note that the `SF::Text` instance doesn't\ncopy the font that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.\nThus, a `SF::Font` must not be destructed while it is\nused by a `SF::Text` (i.e. never write a function that\nuses a local `SF::Font` instance for creating a text).\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# Load a new font from file\nfont = SF::Font.from_file(\"arial.ttf\")\n\n# Create a text which uses our font\ntext1 = SF::Text.new(\"text\", font, 30)\n\n# Create another text using the same font, but with different parameters\ntext2 = SF::Text.new\ntext2.font = font\ntext2.character_size = 50\ntext2.style = SF::Text::Italic\n```\n\nApart from loading font files, and passing them to instances\nof `SF::Text`, you should normally not have to deal directly\nwith this class. However, it may be useful to access the\nfont metrics or rasterized glyphs for advanced usage.\n\nNote that if the font is a bitmap font, it is not scalable,\nthus not all requested sizes will be available to use. This\nneeds to be taken into consideration when using `SF::Text`.\nIf you need to display text of a certain size, make sure the\ncorresponding bitmap font that supports that size is used.\n\n*See also:* `SF::Text`","summary":"<p>Class for loading and manipulating character fonts</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"from_file(*args,**kwargs):self-class-method","html_id":"from_file(*args,**kwargs):self-class-method","name":"from_file","doc":"Shorthand for `font = Font.new;

FTP client\n\n`SF::Ftp` is a very simple FTP client that allows you\nto communicate with a FTP server. The FTP protocol allows\nyou to manipulate a remote file system (list files,\nupload, download, create, remove, ...).\n\nUsing the FTP client consists of 4 parts:\n* Connecting to the FTP server\n* Logging in (either as a registered user or anonymously)\n* Sending commands to the server\n* Disconnecting (this part can be done implicitly by the destructor)\n\nEvery command returns a FTP response, which contains the\nstatus code as well as a message from the server. Some\ncommands such as working_directory() and directory_listing()\nreturn additional data, and use a class derived from\n`SF::Ftp::Response` to provide this data. The most often used\ncommands are directly provided as member functions, but it is\nalso possible to use specific commands with the send_command() function.\n\nNote that response statuses &gt;= 1000 are not part of the FTP standard,\nthey are generated by SFML when an internal error occurs.\n\nAll commands, especially upload and download, may take some\ntime to complete. This is important to know if you don't want\nto block your application while the server is completing\nthe task.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# Create a new FTP client\nftp = SF::Ftp.new\n\n# Connect to the server\nresponse = ftp.connect(\"ftp://ftp.myserver.com\")\nif response.ok?\n  puts \"Connected\"\nend\n\n# Log in\nresponse = ftp.login(\"laurent\", \"dF6Zm89D\")\nif response.ok?\n  puts \"Logged in\"\nend\n\n# Print the working directory\ndirectory = ftp.working_directory()\nif directory.ok?\n  puts \"Working directory: #{directory.directory}\"\nend\n\n# Create a new directory\nresponse = ftp.create_directory \"files\"\nif response.ok?\n  puts \"Created new directory\"\nend\n\n# Upload a file to this new directory\nresponse = ftp.upload(\"local-path/file.txt\", \"files\", SF::Ftp::Ascii)\nif response.ok?)\n  puts \"File uploaded\"\nend\n\n# Send specific commands (here: FEAT to list supported FTP features)\nresponse = ftp.send_command \"FEAT\"\nif response.ok?\n  puts \"Feature list:\\n#{response.message}\"\nend\n\n# Disconnect from the server\nftp.disconnect()\n```","summary":"<p>A FTP client</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new-class-method","html_id":"new-class-method","name":"new","doc":null,"summary":null,"abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":"","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/network/obj.cr#L431","def":{"name":"new","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"","visibility":"Public","body":"_ = allocate\n_.initialize\nif _.responds_to?(:finalize)\n  ::GC.add_finalizer(_)\nend\n_\n"}}],"instance_methods":[{"id":"change_directory(directory:String):Ftp::Response-instance-method","html_id":"change_directory(directory:String):Ftp::Response-instance-method","name":"change_directory","doc":"Change the current working directory\n\nThe new directory must be relative to the current one.\n\n* *directory* - New working directory\n\n*Returns:* Server response to the request\n\n*See also:* `working_directory`, `directory_listing`, `parent_directory`","summary":"<p>Change the current working directory</p>","abstract":false,"args":[{"name":"directory","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"directory","restriction":"String"}],"args_string":"(directory : String) : Ftp::Response","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/network/obj.cr#L818","def":{"name":"change_directory","args":[{"name":"directory","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"directory","restriction":"String"}],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"Ftp::Response","visibility":"Public","body":"result = Ftp::Response.new\nSFMLExt.sfml_ftp_changedirectory_zkC(to_unsafe, directory.bytesize, directory, result)\nreturn result\n"}},{"id":"connect(server:IpAddress,port:Int=21,timeout:Time=Time::Zero):Ftp::Response-instance-method","html_id":"connect(server:IpAddress,port:Int=21,timeout:Time=Time::Zero):Ftp::Response-instance-method","name":"connect","doc":"Connect to the specified FTP server\n\nThe port has a default value of 21, which is the standard\nport used by the FTP protocol.

HTTP client\n\n`SF::Http` is a very simple HTTP client that allows you\nto communicate with a web server. You can retrieve\nweb pages, send data to an interactive resource,\ndownload a remote file, etc. The HTTPS protocol is\nnot supported.\n\nThe HTTP client is split into 3 classes:\n* `SF::Http::Request`\n* `SF::Http::Response`\n* `SF::Http`\n\n`SF::Http::Request` builds the request that will be\nsent to the server. A request is made of:\n* a method (what you want to do)\n* a target URI (usually the name of the web page or file)\n* one or more header fields (options that you can pass to the server)\n* an optional body (for POST requests)\n\n`SF::Http::Response` parse the response from the web server\nand provides getters to read them. The response contains:\n* a status code\n* header fields (that may be answers to the ones that you requested)\n* a body, which contains the contents of the requested resource\n\n`SF::Http` provides a simple function, SendRequest, to send a\n`SF::Http::Request` and return the corresponding `SF::Http::Response`\nfrom the server.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# Create a new HTTP client\nhttp = SF::Http.new(\"http://www.sfml-dev.org\")\n\n# Prepare a request to get the 'features.php' page\nrequest = SF::Http::Request.new(\"features.php\")\n\n# Send the request\nresponse = http.send_request request\n\n# Check the status code and display the result\nSF::Http::Response::Status status = response.getStatus()\nif response.status == SF::Http::Response::Ok\n    puts response.body\nelse\n    puts \"Error #{response.status}\"\nend\n```","summary":"<p>A HTTP client</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new(host:String,port:Int=0)-class-method","html_id":"new(host:String,port:Int=0)-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Construct the HTTP client with the target host\n\nThis is equivalent to calling host=(host, port).\nThe port has a default value of 0, which means that the\nHTTP client will use the right port according to the\nprotocol used (80 for HTTP).

access to the real-time state of the joysticks\n\n`SF::Joystick` provides an interface to the state of the\njoysticks. It only contains static functions, so it's not\nmeant to be instantiated. Instead, each joystick is identified\nby an index that is passed to the functions of this module.\n\nThis module allows users to query the state of joysticks at any\ntime and directly, without having to deal with a window and\nits events. Compared to the `JoystickMoved`, `JoystickButtonPressed`\nand `JoystickButtonReleased` events, `SF::Joystick` can retrieve the\nstate of axes and buttons of joysticks at any time\n(you don't need to store and update a boolean on your side\nin order to know if a button is pressed or released), and you\nalways get the real state of joysticks, even if they are\nmoved, pressed or released when your window is out of focus\nand no event is triggered.\n\nSFML supports:\n* 8 joysticks (`SF::Joystick::Count`)\n* 32 buttons per joystick (`SF::Joystick::ButtonCount`)\n* 8 axes per joystick (`SF::Joystick::AxisCount`)\n\nUnlike the keyboard or mouse, the state of joysticks is sometimes\nnot directly available (depending on the OS), therefore an update()\nfunction must be called in order to update the current state of\njoysticks. When you have a window with event handling, this is done\nautomatically, you don't need to call anything. But if you have no\nwindow, or if you want to check joysticks state before creating one,\nyou must call `SF::Joystick.update` explicitly.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# Is joystick #0 connected?\nconnected = SF::Joystick.connected?(0)\n\n# How many buttons does joystick #0 support?\nbuttons = SF::Joystick.get_button_count(0)\n\n# Does joystick #0 define a X axis?\nhas_x = SF::Joystick.axis?(0, SF::Joystick::X)\n\n# Is button #2 pressed on joystick #0?\npressed = SF::Joystick.button_pressed?(0, 2)\n\n# What's the current position of the Y axis on joystick #0?\nposition = SF::Joystick.get_axis_position(0, SF::Joystick::Y)\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Keyboard`, `SF::Mouse`","summary":"<p>Give access to the real-time state of the joysticks</p>","class_methods":[{"id":"axis?(joystick:Int,axis:Joystick::Axis):Bool-class-method","html_id":"axis?(joystick:Int,axis:Joystick::Axis):Bool-class-method","name":"axis?","doc":"Check if a joystick supports a given axis\n\nIf the joystick is not connected, this function returns false.\n\n* *joystick* -

Compared to the `KeyPressed` and `KeyReleased` events,\n`SF::Keyboard` can retrieve the state of a key at any time\n(you don't need to store and update a boolean on your side\nin order to know if a key is pressed or released), and you\nalways get the real state of the keyboard, even if keys are\npressed or released when your window is out of focus and no\nevent is triggered.\n\nUsage example:\n```\nif SF::Keyboard.key_pressed?(SF::Keyboard::Left)\n  # move left...\nelsif SF::Keyboard.key_pressed?(SF::Keyboard::Right)\n  # move right...\nelsif SF::Keyboard.key_pressed?(SF::Keyboard::Escape)\n  # quit...\nend\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Joystick`, `SF::Mouse`, `SF::Touch`","summary":"<p>Give access to the real-time state of the keyboard</p>","class_methods":[{"id":"key_pressed?(key:Keyboard::Key):Bool-class-method","html_id":"key_pressed?(key:Keyboard::Key):Bool-class-method","name":"key_pressed?","doc":"Check if a key is pressed\n\n* *key* - Key to check\n\n*Returns:* True if the key is pressed, false otherwise","summary":"<p>Check if a key is pressed</p>","abstract":false,"args":[{"name":"key","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"key","restriction":"Keyboard::Key"}],"args_string":"(key : Keyboard::Key) : Bool","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/window/obj.cr#L999","def":{"name":"key_pressed?","args":[{"name":"key","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"key","restriction":"Keyboard::Key"}],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"Bool","visibility":"Public","body":"SFMLExt.sfml_keyboard_iskeypressed_cKW(key, out result)\nreturn result\n"}},{"id":"virtual_keyboard_visible=(visible:Bool)-class-method","html_id":"virtual_keyboard_visible=(visible:Bool)-class-method","name":"virtual_keyboard_visible=","doc":"Show or hide the virtual keyboard\n\nWarning: the virtual keyboard is not supported on all\nsystems.

concurrent access to shared resources\nfrom multiple threads\n\nMutex stands for \"MUTual EXclusion\". A mutex is a\nsynchronization object, used when multiple threads are involved.\n\nWhen you want to protect a part of the code from being accessed\nsimultaneously by multiple threads, you typically use a\nmutex. When a thread is locked by a mutex, any other thread\ntrying to lock it will be blocked until the mutex is released\nby the thread that locked it. This way, you can allow only\none thread at a time to access a critical region of your code.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n@database = Database.new # this is a critical resource that needs some protection\n@mutex = SF::Mutex.new\n\ndef thread1()\n  @mutex.lock() # this call will block the thread if the mutex is already locked by thread2\n  @database.write(...)\n  @mutex.unlock() # if thread2 was waiting, it will now be unblocked\nend\n\ndef thread2()\n  @mutex.lock() # this call will block the thread if the mutex is already locked by thread1\n  @database.write(...)\n  @mutex.unlock() # if thread1 was waiting, it will now be unblocked\nend\n```\n\nBe very careful with mutexes. A bad usage can lead to bad problems,\nlike deadlocks (two threads are waiting for each other and the\napplication is globally stuck).\n\nTo make the usage of mutexes more robust, particularly in\nenvironments where exceptions can be thrown, you should\nuse the helper method `synchronize` to lock/unlock mutexes.\n\nSFML mutexes are recursive, which means that you can lock\na mutex multiple times in the same thread without creating\na deadlock. In this case, the first call to lock() behaves\nas usual, and the following ones have no effect.\nHowever, you must call unlock() exactly as many times as you\ncalled lock(). If you don't, the mutex won't be released.","summary":"<p>Blocks concurrent access to shared resources from multiple

class to build blocks of data to transfer\nover the network\n\nPackets provide a safe and easy way to serialize data,\nin order to send it over the network using sockets\n(`SF::TcpSocket`,

are preserved (one send == one receive)\n\nThe `SF::Packet` class provides both input and output, using `read`\nand `write` methods.\n\nIt is recommended to use only fixed-size types (like `Int32`, etc.),\nto avoid possible differences between the sender and the receiver.\n\nUsage example:\n```\nx = 24u32\ns = \"hello\"\nd = 5.89\n\n# Group the variables to send into a packet\npacket = SF::Packet.new\npacket.write x\npacket.write s\npacket.write d\n\n# Send it over the network (socket is a valid SF::TcpSocket)\nsocket.send packet\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Receive the packet at the other end\npacket = SF::Packet.new\nsocket.receive(packet)\n\n# Extract the variables contained in the packet\nx = packet.read UInt32\ns = packet.read String\nd = packet.read Float64\nif packet.valid?\n  # Data extracted successfully...\nend\n```\n\nPackets have overloads of `read` and `write` methods for standard types:\n\n* Bool\n* Fixed-size integer types (`Int8/16/32/64`, `UInt8/16/32/64`)\n* Floating point numbers (`Float32/64`)\n* `String`\n\nLike standard streams, it is also possible to define your own overloads\nof these methods in order to handle your custom types.\n\n```\nstruct MyStruct\n  number : Float32\n  integer : Int8\n  str : String\nend\n\nclass SF::Packet\n

struct for manipulating 2D axis aligned rectangles\n\nA rectangle is defined by its top-left corner and its size.\nIt is a very simple struct defined for convenience, so\nits member variables (`left`, `top`, `width` and `height`)\ncan be accessed directly, just like the vector classes\n(`Vector2` and `Vector3`).\n\nTo keep things simple, `SF::Rect` doesn't define\nfunctions to emulate the properties that are not directly\nmembers (such as right, bottom, center, etc.), it rather\nonly provides intersection functions.\n\n`SF::Rect` uses the usual rules for its boundaries:\n* The left and top edges are included in the rectangle's area\n* The right (left + width) and bottom (top + height) edges are excluded from the rectangle's area\n\nThis means that `SF::IntRect.new(0, 0, 1, 1)` and\n`SF::IntRect.new(1, 1, 1, 1)` don't intersect.\n\n`SF::Rect` is a generic and may be used with any numeric type, but\nfor simplicity the instantiations used by SFML are aliased:\n* `SF::Rect(Int32)` is `SF::IntRect`\n* `SF::Rect(Float32)` is `SF::FloatRect`\n\nSo that you don't have to care about the template syntax.\n\nSee also: `SF.int_rect`, `SF.float_rect`.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# Define a rectangle, located at (0, 0) with a size of 20x5\nr1 = SF.int_rect(0, 0, 20, 5)\n\n# Define another rectangle, located at (4, 2) with a size of 18x10\nposition = SF.vector2i(4, 2)\nsize = SF.vector2i(18, 10)\nr2 = SF::IntRect.new(position, size)\n\n# Test intersections with the point (3, 1)\nr1.contains?(3, 1) #=> true\nr2.contains?(3, 1) #=> false\n\n# Test the intersection between r1 and r2\nr1.intersects?(r2) #=> (4, 2, 16, 3)\n```","summary":"<p>Utility struct for manipulating 2D axis aligned

that can serve as a target for 2D drawing\n\n`SF::RenderWindow` is the main class of the Graphics module.\nIt defines an OS window that can be painted using the other\nclasses of the graphics module.\n\n`SF::RenderWindow` is derived from `SF::Window`, thus it inherits\nall its features: events, window management, OpenGL rendering,\netc. See the documentation of `SF::Window` for a more complete\ndescription of all these features, as well as code examples.\n\nOn top of that, `SF::RenderWindow` adds more features related to\n2D drawing with the graphics module (see its base module\n`SF::RenderTarget` for more details).\nHere is a typical rendering and event loop with a `SF::RenderWindow:`\n\n```\n# Declare and create a new render-window\nwindow = SF::RenderWindow.new(SF::VideoMode.new(800, 600), \"SFML window\")\n\n# Limit the framerate to 60 frames per second (this step is optional)\nwindow.framerate_limit = 60\n\n# The main loop - ends as

It is even possible to mix together OpenGL calls\nand regular SFML drawing commands.\n\n```\n# Create the render window\nwindow = SF::RenderWindow.new(SF::VideoMode.new(800, 600), \"SFML OpenGL\")\n\n# Create a sprite and a text to display\nsprite = SF::Sprite.new\ntext = SF::Text.new\n...\n\n# Perform OpenGL initializations\nglMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)\n...\n\n# Start the rendering loop\nwhile window.open?\n  # Process events\n  ...\n\n  # Draw a background sprite\n  window.push_gl_states()\n  window.draw sprite\n  window.pop_gl_states()\n\n  # Draw a 3D object using OpenGL\n  glBegin(GL_QUADS)\n    glVertex3f(...)\n    ...\n  glEnd()\n\n  # Draw text on top of the 3D object\n  window.push_gl_states()\n  window.draw text\n  window.pop_gl_states()\n\n  # Finally, display the rendered frame on screen\n  window.display()\nend\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Window`, `SF::RenderTarget`, `SF::RenderTexture`, `SF::View`","summary":"<p>Window that can serve as a target for 2D drawing</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new(mode:VideoMode,title:String,style:Style=Style::Default,settings:ContextSettings=ContextSettings.new)-class-method","html_id":"new(mode:VideoMode,title:String,style:Style=Style::Default,settings:ContextSettings=ContextSettings.new)-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Construct a new window\n\nThis constructor creates the window with the size and pixel\ndepth defined in *mode.* An optional style can be passed to\ncustomize the look and behavior of the window (borders,\ntitle bar, resizable, closable, ...).\n\nThe fourth parameter is an optional structure specifying\nadvanced OpenGL context settings such as antialiasing,\ndepth-buffer bits, etc. You shouldn't care about these\nparameters for a regular usage of the graphics module.\n\n* *mode* -

class (vertex, geometry and fragment)\n\nShaders are programs written using a specific language,\nexecuted directly by the graphics card and allowing\nto apply real-time operations to the rendered entities.\n\nThere are three kinds of shaders:\n* Vertex shaders, that process vertices\n* Geometry shaders, that process primitives\n* Fragment (pixel) shaders, that process pixels\n\nA `SF::Shader` can be composed of either a vertex shader\nalone, a geometry shader alone, a fragment shader alone,\nor any combination of them. (see the variants of the\nload functions).\n\nShaders are written in GLSL, which is a C-like\nlanguage dedicated to OpenGL shaders. You'll probably\nneed to learn its basics before writing your own shaders\nfor SFML.\n\nLike any C/C++ program, a GLSL shader has its own variables\ncalled *uniforms* that you can set from your C++ application.\n`SF::Shader` handles different types of uniforms:\n* scalars: `float`, `int`, `bool`\n* vectors (2, 3 or 4 components)\n* matrices (3x3 or 4x4)\n* samplers (textures)\n\nSome SFML-specific types can be converted:\n* `SF::Color` as a 4D vector (`vec4`)\n* `SF::Transform` as matrices (`mat3` or `mat4`)\n\nEvery uniform variable in a shader can be set through one of the\n`set_parameter` overloads, or through a shorthand. For example, if you\nhave a shader with the following uniforms:\n```glsl\nuniform float offset;\nuniform vec3 point;\nuniform vec4 color;\nuniform mat4 matrix;\nuniform sampler2D overlay;\nuniform sampler2D current;\n```\nYou can set their values from Crystal code as follows:\n```\nshader.offset 2.0\nshader.point 0.5, 0.8, 0.3\nshader.color color          # color is a SF::Color\nshader.matrix transform     # transform is a SF::Transform\nshader.overlay texture      # texture is a SF::Texture\nshader.current SF::Shader::CurrentTexture\n```\n\nThe special Shader::CurrentTexture argument maps the\ngiven `sampler2d` uniform to the current texture of the\nobject being drawn (which cannot be known in advance).\n\nTo apply a shader to a drawable, you must pass it as an\nadditional parameter to the `Window.draw` function:\n```\nstates = SF::RenderStates.new(shader)\nwindow.draw(sprite, states)\n```\n\nIn the code above we pass a pointer to the shader, because it may\nbe null (which means \"no shader\").\n\nShaders can be used on any drawable, but some combinations are\nnot interesting. For example, using a vertex shader on a `SF::Sprite`\nis limited because there are only 4 vertices, the sprite would\nhave to be subdivided in order to apply wave effects.\nAnother bad example is a fragment shader with `SF::Text:` the texture\nof the text is not the actual text that you see on screen, it is\na big texture containing all the characters of the font in an\narbitrary order; thus, texture lookups on pixels other than the\ncurrent one may not give you the expected result.\n\nShaders can also be used to apply global post-effects to the\ncurrent contents of the target. This can be done in two different ways:\n* draw everything to a `SF::RenderTexture`, then draw it to\nthe main target using the shader\n* draw everything directly to the main target, then use\n`SF::Texture::update(window)` to copy its contents to a texture\nand draw it to the main target using the shader\n\nThe first technique is more optimized because it doesn't involve\nretrieving the target's pixels to system memory, but the\nsecond one doesn't impact the rendering process and can be\neasily inserted anywhere without impacting all the code.\n\nLike `SF::Texture` that can be used as a raw OpenGL texture,\n`SF::Shader` can also be used directly as a raw shader for\ncustom OpenGL geometry.\n```\nSF::Shader.bind shader\n... render OpenGL geometry ...\nSF::Shader.bind nil\n```","summary":"<p>Shader class (vertex, geometry and fragment)</p>","class_methods":[{"id":"available?:Bool-class-method","html_id":"available?:Bool-class-method","name":"available?","doc":"Tell whether or not the system supports shaders\n\nThis function should always be called before using\nthe shader features.

that allows to read from multiple sockets\n\nSocket selectors provide a way to wait until some data is\navailable on a set of sockets, instead of just one. This\nis convenient when you have multiple sockets that may\npossibly receive data, but you don't know which one will\nbe ready first. In particular, it avoids to use a thread\nfor each socket; with selectors, a single thread can handle\nall the sockets.\n\nAll types of sockets can be used in a selector:\n* `SF::TcpListener`\n* `SF::TcpSocket`\n* `SF::UdpSocket`\n\nA selector doesn't store its own copies of the sockets\n(socket classes are not copyable anyway), it simply keeps\na reference to the original sockets that you pass to the\n\"add\" function. Therefore, you can't use the selector as a\nsocket container, you must store them outside and make sure\nthat they are alive as long as they are used in the selector.\n\nUsing a selector is simple:\n* populate the selector with all the sockets that you want to observe\n* make it wait until there is data available on any of the sockets\n* test each socket to find out which ones are ready\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# Create a socket to listen to new connections\nlistener = SF::TcpListener.new\nlistener.listen(55001)\n\n# Create an array to store the future clients\nclients = [] of SF::TcpSocket\n\n# Create a selector\nselector = SF::SocketSelector.new\n\n# Add the listener to the selector\nselector.add listener\n\n# Endless loop that waits for new connections\nwhile running\n  # Make the selector wait for data on any socket\n  if selector.wait()\n    # Test the listener\n    if selector.ready?(listener)\n      # The listener is ready: there is a pending connection\n      client = SF::TcpSocket.new\n      if listener.accept(client) == SF::Socket::Done\n        # Add the new client to the clients list\n        clients << client\n\n        # Add the new client to the selector so that we will\n        # be notified when he sends something\n        selector.add client\n      end\n    else\n      # The listener socket is not ready, test all other sockets (the clients)\n      clients.each do |client|\n        if selector.ready?(client)\n          # The client has sent some data, we can receive it\n          packet = SF::Packet.new\n          if client.receive(packet) == SF::Socket::Done\n              ...\n          end\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Socket`","summary":"<p>Multiplexer that allows to read from multiple sockets</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new-class-method","html_id":"new-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Default constructor","summary":"<p>Default constructor</p>","abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":"","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/network/obj.cr#L1953","def":{"name":"new","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"","visibility":"Public","body":"_ = allocate\n_.initialize\nif _.responds_to?(:finalize)\n  ::GC.add_finalizer(_)\nend\n_\n"}}],"instance_methods":[{"id":"add(socket:Socket)-instance-method","html_id":"add(socket:Socket)-instance-method","name":"add","doc":"Add a new socket to the selector\n\nThis function keeps a weak reference to the socket,\nso you have to make sure that the socket is not destroyed\nwhile it is stored in the selector.\nThis function does nothing if the socket is not valid.\n\n* *socket* -

A sample is a 16 bits signed integer\nthat defines the amplitude of the sound at a given time.\nThe sound is then reconstituted by playing these samples at\na high rate (for example, 44100 samples per second is the\nstandard rate used for playing CDs). In short, audio samples\nare like texture pixels, and a `SF::SoundBuffer` is similar to\na `SF::Texture`.\n\nA sound buffer can be loaded from a file (see load_from_file()\nfor the complete list of supported formats), from memory, from\na custom stream (see `SF::InputStream`) or directly from an array\nof samples. It can also be saved back to a file.\n\nSound buffers alone are not very useful: they hold the audio data\nbut cannot be played. To do so, you need to use the `SF::Sound` class,\nwhich provides functions to play/pause/stop the sound as well as\nchanging the way it is outputted (volume, pitch, 3D position, ...).\nThis separation allows more flexibility and better performances:\nindeed a `SF::SoundBuffer` is a heavy resource, and any operation on it\nis slow (often too slow for real-time applications). On the other\nside, a `SF::Sound` is a lightweight object, which can use the audio data\nof a sound buffer and change the way it is played without actually\nmodifying that data. Note that it is also possible to bind\nseveral `SF::Sound` instances to the same `SF::SoundBuffer`.\n\nIt is important to note that the `SF::Sound` instance doesn't\ncopy the buffer that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.\nThus, a `SF::SoundBuffer` must not be destructed while it is\nused by a `SF::Sound` (i.e. never write a function that\nuses a local `SF::SoundBuffer` instance for loading a sound).\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# Load a new sound buffer from a file\nbuffer = SF::SoundBuffer.from_file(\"sound.wav\")\n\n# Create a sound source and bind it to the buffer\nsound1 = SF::Sound.new\nsound1.buffer = buffer\n\n# Play the sound\nsound1.play()\n\n# Create another sound source bound to the same buffer\nsound2 = SF::Sound.new\nsound2.buffer = buffer\n\n# Play it with a higher pitch -- the first sound remains unchanged\nsound2.pitch = 2\nsound2.play()\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Sound`, `SF::SoundBufferRecorder`","summary":"<p>Storage for audio samples defining a

base class for capturing sound data\n\n`SF::SoundBuffer` provides a simple interface to access\nthe audio recording capabilities of the computer\n(the microphone). As an abstract base class, it only cares\nabout capturing sound samples, the task of making something\nuseful with them is left to the derived class. Note that\nSFML provides a built-in specialization for saving the\ncaptured data to a sound buffer (see `SF::SoundBufferRecorder`).\n\nA derived class has only one virtual function to override:\n* on_process_samples provides the new chunks of audio samples while the capture happens\n\nMoreover, two additional virtual functions can be overridden\nas well if necessary:\n* on_start is called before the capture happens, to perform custom initializations\n* on_stop is called after the capture ends, to perform custom cleanup\n\nA derived class can also control the frequency of the on_process_samples\ncalls, with the processing_interval= protected function. The default\ninterval is chosen so that recording thread doesn't consume too much\nCPU, but it can be changed to a smaller value if you need to process\nthe recorded data in real time, for example.\n\nThe audio capture feature may not be supported or activated\non every platform, thus it is recommended to check its\navailability with the available?() function. If it returns\nfalse, then any attempt to use an audio recorder will fail.\n\nIf you have multiple sound input devices connected to your\ncomputer (for example: microphone, external soundcard, webcam mic, ...)\nyou can get a list of all available devices through the\navailable_devices() function. You can then select a device\nby calling device=() with the appropriate device. Otherwise\nthe default capturing device will be used.\n\nBy default the recording is in 16-bit mono. Using the\nchannel_count= method you can change the number of channels\nused by the audio capture device to record. Note that you\nhave to decide whether you want to record in mono or stereo\nbefore starting the recording.\n\nIt is important to note that the audio capture happens in a\nseparate thread, so that it doesn't block the rest of the\nprogram. In particular, the on_process_samples virtual function\n(but not on_start and not on_stop) will be called\nfrom this separate thread. It is important to keep this in\nmind, because you may have to take care of synchronization\nissues if you share data between threads.\nAnother thing to bear in mind is that you must call stop()\nin the destructor of your derived class, so that the recording\nthread finishes before your object is destroyed.\n\nUsage example:\n```\nclass CustomRecorder < SF::SoundRecorder\n  def finalize\n    # Make sure to stop the recording thread\n    stop()\n  end\n\n  def on_start() # optional\n    # Initialize whatever has to be done before the capture starts\n    ...\n\n    # Return true to start playing\n    true\n  end\n\n  def on_process_samples(samples)\n    # Do something with the new chunk of samples (store them, send them, ...)\n    ...\n\n    # Return true to continue playing\n    true\n  end\n\n  def on_stop() # optional\n    # Clean up whatever has to be done after the capture ends\n    ...\n  end\nend\n\n# Usage\nif (CustomRecorder.isAvailable())\n    CustomRecorder recorder\n\n    if (!recorder.start())\n        return -1\n\n    ...\n    recorder.stop()\nend\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::SoundBufferRecorder`","summary":"<p>Abstract base class for capturing sound data</p>","class_methods":[{"id":"available?:Bool-class-method","html_id":"available?:Bool-class-method","name":"available?","doc":"Check if the system supports audio capture\n\nThis function should always be called before using\nthe audio capture features.

base class for streamed audio sources\n\nUnlike audio buffers (see `SF::SoundBuffer`), audio streams\nare never completely loaded in memory. Instead, the audio\ndata is acquired continuously while the stream is playing.\nThis behavior allows to play a sound with no loading delay,\nand keeps the memory consumption very low.\n\nSound sources that need to be streamed are usually big files\n(compressed audio musics that would eat hundreds of MB in memory)\nor files that would take a lot of time to be received\n(sounds played over the network).\n\n`SF::SoundStream` is a base class that doesn't care about the\nstream source, which is left to the derived class. SFML provides\na built-in specialization for big files (see `SF::Music`).\nNo network stream source is provided, but you can write your own\nby combining this class with the network module.\n\nA derived class has to override two virtual functions:\n* on_get_data fills a new chunk of audio data to be played\n* on_seek changes the current playing position in the source\n\nIt is important to note that each SoundStream is played in its\nown separate thread, so that the streaming loop doesn't block the\nrest of the program. In particular, the OnGetData and OnSeek\nvirtual functions may sometimes be called from this separate thread.\nIt is important to keep this in mind, because you may have to take\ncare of synchronization issues if you share data between threads.\n\nUsage example:\n```\nclass CustomStream < SF::SoundStream\n  def initialize(location : String)\n    # Open the source and get audio settings\n    ...\n\n    # Initialize the stream -- important!\n    super(channel_count, sample_rate)\n  end\n\n  def on_get_data()\n    # Return a slice with audio data from the stream source\n    # (note: must not be empty if you want to continue playing)\n    Slice.new(samples.to_unsafe, samples.size)\n  end\n\n  def on_seek(time_offset)\n    # Change the current position in the stream source\n  end\nend\n\n# Usage\nstream = CustomStream.new(\"path/to/stream\")\nstream.play()\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Music`","summary":"<p>Abstract base class for streamed audio sources</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new(channel_count:Int,sample_rate:Int)-class-method","html_id":"new(channel_count:Int,sample_rate:Int)-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Define the audio stream parameters\n\nThis function must be called by derived classes as soon\nas they know the audio settings of the stream to play.\nAny attempt to manipulate the stream (play(), ...) before\ncalling this function will fail.\nIt can be called multiple times if the settings of the\naudio stream change, but only when the stream is stopped.\n\n* *channel_count* -

It also adds sprite-specific\nproperties such as the texture to use, the part of it to display,\nand some convenience functions to change the overall color of the\nsprite, or to get its bounding rectangle.\n\n`SF::Sprite` works in combination with the `SF::Texture` class, which\nloads and provides the pixel data of a given texture.\n\nThe separation of `SF::Sprite` and `SF::Texture` allows more flexibility\nand better performances: indeed a `SF::Texture` is a heavy resource,\nand any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time\napplications).

It can't send or receive anything if it is not connected.\n\nThe TCP protocol is reliable but adds a slight overhead.\nIt ensures that your data will always be received in order\nand without errors (no data corrupted, lost or duplicated).\n\nWhen a socket is connected to a remote host, you can\nretrieve informations about this host with the\nremote_address and remote_port functions. You can\nalso get the local port to which the socket is bound\n(which is automatically chosen when the socket is connected),\nwith the local_port function.\n\nSending and receiving data can use either the low-level\nor the high-level functions. The low-level functions\nprocess a raw sequence of bytes, and cannot ensure that\none call to Send will exactly match one call to Receive\nat the other end of the socket.\n\nThe high-level interface uses packets (see `SF::Packet`),\nwhich are easier to use and provide more safety regarding\nthe data that is exchanged. You can look at the `SF::Packet`\nclass to get more details about how they work.\n\nThe socket is automatically disconnected when it is destroyed,\nbut if you want to explicitly close the connection while\nthe socket instance is still alive, you can call disconnect.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# ----- The client -----\n\n# Create a socket and connect it to 192.168.1.50 on port 55001\nsocket = SF::TcpSocket.new\nsocket.connect(\"192.168.1.50\", 55001)\n\n# Send a message to the connected host\nmessage = \"Hi, I am a client\"\nsocket.send(message.to_slice)\n\n# Receive an answer from the server\nbuffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)\nstatus, received = socket.receive(buffer)\nputs \"The server said: #{buffer}\"\n\n# ----- The server -----\n\n# Create a listener to wait for incoming connections on port 55001\nlistener = SF::TcpListener.new\nlistener.listen(55001)\n\n# Wait for a connection\nsocket = SF::TcpSocket.new\nlistener.accept(socket)\nputs \"New client connected: #{socket.remote_address}\"\n\n# Receive a message from the client\nbuffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)\nstatus, received = socket.receive(buffer)\nputs \"The client said: #{buffer}\"\n\n# Send an answer\nmessage = \"Welcome, client\"\nsocket.send(message.to_slice)\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Socket`, `SF::UdpSocket`, `SF::Packet`","summary":"<p>Specialized socket using the TCP protocol</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new-class-method","html_id":"new-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Default constructor","summary":"<p>Default constructor</p>","abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":"","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/network/obj.cr#L189","def":{"name":"new","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"","visibility":"Public","body":"_ = allocate\n_.initialize\nif _.responds_to?(:finalize)\n  ::GC.add_finalizer(_)\nend\n_\n"}}],"instance_methods":[{"id":"connect(remote_address:IpAddress,remote_port:Int,timeout:Time=Time::Zero):Socket::Status-instance-method","html_id":"connect(remote_address:IpAddress,remote_port:Int,timeout:Time=Time::Zero):Socket::Status-instance-method","name":"connect","doc":"Connect the socket to a remote peer\n\nIn blocking mode, this function may take a while, especially\nif the remote peer is not reachable.

It also adds text-specific\nproperties such as the font to use, the character size,\nthe font style (bold, italic, underlined and strike through), the\ntext color, the outline thickness, the outline color, the character\nspacing, the line spacing and the text to display of course.\nIt also provides convenience functions to calculate the\ngraphical size of the text, or to get the global position\nof a given character.\n\n`SF::Text` works in combination with the `SF::Font` class, which\nloads and provides the glyphs (visual characters) of a given font.\n\nThe separation of `SF::Font` and `SF::Text` allows more flexibility\nand better performances: indeed a `SF::Font` is a heavy resource,\nand any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time\napplications).

living on the graphics card that can be used for drawing\n\n`SF::Texture` stores pixels that can be drawn, with a sprite\nfor example. A texture lives in the graphics card memory,\ntherefore it is very fast to draw a texture to a render target,\nor copy a render target to a texture (the graphics card can\naccess both directly).\n\nBeing stored in the graphics card memory has some drawbacks.\nA texture cannot be manipulated as freely as a `SF::Image`,\nyou need to prepare the pixels first and then upload them\nto the texture in a single operation (see Texture.update).\n\n`SF::Texture` makes it easy to convert from/to `SF::Image`, but\nkeep in mind that these calls require transfers between\nthe graphics card and the central memory, therefore they are\nslow operations.\n\nA texture can be loaded from an image, but also directly\nfrom a file/memory/stream. The necessary shortcuts are defined\nso that you don't need an image first for the most common cases.\nHowever, if you want to perform some modifications on the pixels\nbefore creating the final texture, you can load your file to a\n`SF::Image`, do whatever you need with the pixels, and then call\nTexture.load_from_image.\n\nSince they live in the graphics card memory, the pixels of a texture\ncannot be accessed without a slow copy first. And they cannot be\naccessed individually. Therefore, if you need to read the texture's\npixels (like for pixel-perfect collisions), it is recommended to\nstore the collision information separately, for example in an array\nof booleans.\n\nLike `SF::Image`, `SF::Texture` can handle a unique internal\nrepresentation of pixels, which is RGBA 32 bits. This means\nthat a pixel must be composed of 8 bits red, green, blue and\nalpha channels -- just like a `SF::Color`.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# This example shows the most common use of SF::Texture:\n# drawing a sprite\n\n# Load a texture from a file\ntexture = SF::Texture.from_file(\"texture.png\")\n\n# Assign it to a sprite\nsprite = SF::Sprite.new(texture)\n\n# Draw the textured sprite\nwindow.draw sprite\n```\n\n```\n# This example shows another common use of SF::Texture:\n# streaming real-time data, like video frames\n\n# Create an empty texture\ntexture = SF::Texture.new(640, 480)\n\n# Create a sprite that will display the texture\nsprite = SF::Sprite.new(texture)\n\nloop do # the main loop\n  ...\n\n  # update the texture\n  pixels = (...).to_unsafe # get a fresh chunk of pixels (the next frame of a movie, for example)\n  texture.update(pixels)\n\n  # draw it\n  window.draw sprite\n\n  ...\nend\n\n```\n\nLike `SF::Shader` that can be used as a raw OpenGL shader,\n`SF::Texture` can also be used directly as a raw texture for\ncustom OpenGL geometry.\n```\nSF::Texture.bind(texture)\n... render OpenGL geometry ...\nSF::Texture.bind(nil)\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Sprite`, `SF::Image`, `SF::RenderTexture`","summary":"<p>Image living on the graphics card that can be used for drawing</p>","class_methods":[{"id":"bind(texture:Texture?,coordinate_type:Texture::CoordinateType=Normalized)-class-method","html_id":"bind(texture:Texture?,coordinate_type:Texture::CoordinateType=Normalized)-class-method","name":"bind","doc":"Bind a texture for rendering\n\nThis function is not part of the graphics API, it mustn't be\nused when drawing SFML entities.

If Normalized (the default), they\nmust be in range `0.0 .. 1.0`, which is the default way of handling\ntexture coordinates with OpenGL. If Pixels, they must be given\nin pixels (range `0.0 .. size`).

When you launch a new thread, the execution\nis split and both the new thread and the caller run\nin parallel.\n\nTo use a `SF::Thread`, you construct it directly with the\nfunction to execute as the entry point of the thread.\n`SF::Thread` has multiple template constructors, which means\nthat you can use several types of entry points:\n* non-member functions with no argument\n* non-member functions with one argument of any type\n* functors with no argument (this one is particularly useful for compatibility with boost/std::%bind)\n* functors with one argument of any type\n* member functions from any class with no argument\n\nThe function argument, if any, is copied in the `SF::Thread`\ninstance, as well as the functor (if the corresponding\nconstructor is used). Class instances, however, are passed\nby pointer so you must make sure that the object won't be\ndestroyed while the thread is still using it.\n\nThe thread ends when its function is terminated. If the\nowner `SF::Thread` instance is destroyed before the\nthread is finished, the destructor will wait (see wait())\n\nUsage examples:\n```c++\n# example 1: non member function with one argument\n\nvoid threadFunc(int argument)\n    ...\nend\n\nthread = SF::Thread.new(&threadFunc, 5)\nthread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls threadFunc(5))\n```\n\n```c++\n# example 2: member function\n\nclass Task\npublic:\n    void run()\n        ...\n    end\nend\n\nTask task\nthread = SF::Thread.new(&Task.run, &task)\nthread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls task.run())\n```\n\n```c++\n# example 3: functor\n\nstruct Task\n    void operator()()\n        ...\n    end\nend\n\nthread = SF::Thread.new(Task())\nthread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls operator() on the Task instance)\n```\n\nCreating parallel threads of execution can be dangerous:\nall threads inside the same process share the same memory space,\nwhich means that you may end up accessing the same variable\nfrom multiple threads at the same time.

Indeed,\none can easily combine any kind of operation, such as a translation\nfollowed by a rotation followed by a scaling, but once the result\ntransform is built, there's no way to go backward and, let's say,\nchange only the rotation without modifying the translation and scaling.\nThe entire transform must be recomputed, which means that you\nneed to retrieve the initial translation and scale factors as\nwell, and combine them the same way you did before updating the\nrotation. This is a tedious operation, and it requires to store\nall the individual components of the final transform.\n\nThat's exactly what `SF::Transformable` was written for: it hides\nthese variables and the composed transform behind an easy to use\ninterface. You can set or get any of the individual components\nwithout worrying about the others. It also provides the composed\ntransform (as a `SF::Transform`), and keeps it up-to-date.\n\nIn addition to the position, rotation and scale, `SF::Transformable`\nprovides an \"origin\" component, which represents the local origin\nof the three other components. Let's take an example with a 10x10\npixels sprite. By default, the sprite is positioned/rotated/scaled\nrelatively to its top-left corner, because it is the local point\n(0, 0). But if we change the origin to be (5, 5), the sprite will\nbe positioned/rotated/scaled around its center instead. And if\nwe set the origin to (10, 10), it will be transformed around its\nbottom-right corner.\n\nTo keep the `SF::Transformable` class simple, there's only one\norigin for all the components. You cannot position the sprite\nrelatively to its top-left corner while rotating it around its\ncenter, for example. To do such things, use `SF::Transform` directly.\n\n`SF::Transformable` can be used as a base class. It is often\ncombined with `SF::Drawable` -- that's what SFML's sprites,\ntexts and shapes do.\n```\nclass MyEntity < SF::Transformable\n  include SF::Drawable\n\n  def draw(target, states)\n    states.transform *= self.transform\n    target.draw(..., states)\n  end\nend\n\nentity = MyEntity.new\nentity.position = {10, 20}\nentity.rotation = 45\nwindow.draw entity\n```\n\nIt can also be used as a member, if you don't want to use\nits API directly (because you don't need all its functions,\nor you have different naming conventions for example).\n```\nclass MyEntity\n  @transform : SF::Transformable\n  forward_missing_to @transform\nend\n```\n\nA note on coordinates and undistorted rendering:\nBy default, SFML (or more exactly, OpenGL) may interpolate drawable objects\nsuch as sprites or texts when rendering. While this allows transitions\nlike slow movements or rotations to appear smoothly, it can lead to\nunwanted results in some cases, for example blurred or distorted objects.\nIn order to render a `SF::Drawable` object pixel-perfectly, make sure\nthe involved coordinates allow a 1:1 mapping of pixels in the window\nto texels (pixels in the texture). More specifically, this means:\n* The object's position, origin and scale have no fractional part\n* The object's and the view's rotation are a multiple of 90 degrees\n* The view's center and size have no fractional part\n\n*See also:* `SF::Transform`","summary":"<p>Decomposed transform defined by a position, a rotation and a scale</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new-class-method","html_id":"new-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Default constructor","summary":"<p>Default constructor</p>","abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":"","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/graphics/obj.cr#L934","def":{"name":"new","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"","visibility":"Public","body":"_ = allocate\n_.initialize\nif _.responds_to?(:finalize)\n  ::GC.add_finalizer(_)\nend\n_\n"}}],"instance_methods":[{"id":"dup:Transformable-instance-method","html_id":"dup:Transformable-instance-method","name":"dup","doc":"Returns a shallow copy of this object.\n\nThis allocates a new object and copies the contents of\n`self` into it.","summary":"<p>Returns a shallow copy of this object.</p>","abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":" : Transformable","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/graphics/obj.cr#L1193","def":{"name":"dup","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"Transformable","visibility":"Public","body":"return Transformable.new(self)"}},{"id":"finalize-instance-method","html_id":"finalize-instance-method","name":"finalize","doc":"Virtual destructor","summary":"<p>Virtual destructor</p>","abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":"","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/graphics/obj.cr#L939","def":{"name":"finalize","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"","visibility":"Public","body":"SFMLExt.sfml_transformable_finalize(to_unsafe)\nSFMLExt.sfml_transformable_free(@this)\n"}},{"id":"inverse_transform:Transform-instance-method","html_id":"inverse_transform:Transform-instance-method","name":"inverse_transform","doc":"get the inverse of the combined transform of the object\n\n*Returns:* Inverse of the combined transformations applied to the object\n\n*See also:* `transform`","summary":"<p>get the inverse of the combined transform of the object</p>","abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":" : Transform","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/graphics/obj.cr#L1175","def":{"name":"inverse_transform","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"Transform","visibility":"Public","body":"result = Transform.allocate\nSFMLExt.sfml_transformable_getinversetransform(to_unsafe, result)\nreturn result\n"}},{"id":"move(offset:Vector2|Tuple)-instance-method","html_id":"move(offset:Vector2|Tuple)-instance-method","name":"move","doc":"Move the object by a given offset\n\nThis function adds to the current position of the object,\nunlike position= which overwrites it.\nThus, it is equivalent to the following code:\n```\nobject.position += offset\n```\n\n* *offset* -

Instead of\nconnecting once to a remote host, like TCP sockets,\nit can send to and receive from any host at any time.\n\nIt is a datagram protocol: bounded blocks of data (datagrams)\nare transfered over the network rather than a continuous\nstream of data (TCP). Therefore, one call to send will always\nmatch one call to receive (if the datagram is not lost),\nwith the same data that was sent.\n\nThe UDP protocol is lightweight but unreliable. Unreliable\nmeans that datagrams may be duplicated, be lost or\narrive reordered. However, if a datagram arrives, its\ndata is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nUDP is generally used for real-time communication\n(audio or video streaming, real-time games, etc.) where\nspeed is crucial and lost data doesn't matter much.\n\nSending and receiving data can use either the low-level\nor the high-level functions. The low-level functions\nprocess a raw sequence of bytes, whereas the high-level\ninterface uses packets (see `SF::Packet`), which are easier\nto use and provide more safety regarding the data that is\nexchanged. You can look at the `SF::Packet` class to get\nmore details about how they work.\n\nIt is important to note that UdpSocket is unable to send\ndatagrams bigger than MaxDatagramSize. In this case, it\nreturns an error and doesn't send anything. This applies\nto both raw data and packets. Indeed, even packets are\nunable to split and recompose data, due to the unreliability\nof the protocol (dropped, mixed or duplicated datagrams may\nlead to a big mess when trying to recompose a packet).\n\nIf the socket is bound to a port, it is automatically\nunbound from it when the socket is destroyed. However,\nyou can unbind the socket explicitly with the Unbind\nfunction if necessary, to stop receiving messages or\nmake the port available for other sockets.\n\nUsage example:\n```\n# ----- The client -----\n\n# Create a socket and bind it to the port 55001\nsocket = SF::UdpSocket.new\nsocket.bind(55001)\n\n# Send a message to 192.168.1.50 on port 55002\nmessage = \"Hi, I am #{SF::IpAddress.local_address}\"\nsocket.send(message.to_slice, \"192.168.1.50\", 55002)\n\n# Receive an answer (most likely from 192.168.1.50, but could be anyone else)\nbuffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)\nstatus, received, sender, port = socket.receive(buffer)\nputs \"#{sender} said: #{buffer}\"\n\n# ----- The server -----\n\n# Create a socket and bind it to the port 55002\nsocket = SF::UdpSocket.new\nsocket.bind(55002)\n\n# Receive a message from anyone\nbuffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)\nstatus, received, sender, port = socket.receive(buffer)\nputs \"#{sender} said: #{buffer}\"\n\n# Send an answer\nmessage = \"Welcome #{sender}\"\nsocket.send(message.to_slice, sender, port)\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Socket`, `SF::TcpSocket`, `SF::Packet`","summary":"<p>Specialized socket using the UDP protocol</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[{"id":"new-class-method","html_id":"new-class-method","name":"new","doc":"Default constructor","summary":"<p>Default constructor</p>","abstract":false,"args":[],"args_string":"","source_link":"https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/src/network/obj.cr#L2257","def":{"name":"new","args":[],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"yields":null,"block_arg":null,"return_type":"","visibility":"Public","body":"_ = allocate\n_.initialize\nif _.responds_to?(:finalize)\n  ::GC.add_finalizer(_)\nend\n_\n"}}],"instance_methods":[{"id":"bind(port:Int,address:IpAddress=IpAddress::Any):Socket::Status-instance-method","html_id":"bind(port:Int,address:IpAddress=IpAddress::Any):Socket::Status-instance-method","name":"bind","doc":"Bind the socket to a specific port\n\nBinding the socket to a port is necessary for being\nable to receive data on that port.\nYou can use the special value Socket::AnyPort to tell the\nsystem to automatically pick an available port, and then\ncall local_port to retrieve the chosen port.\n\nSince the socket can only be bound to a single port at\nany given moment, if it is already bound when this\nfunction is called, it will be unbound from the previous\nport before being bound to the new one.\n\n* *port* -

a point with color and texture coordinates\n\nA vertex is an improved point. It has a position and other\nextra attributes that will be used for drawing: in SFML,\nvertices also have a color and a pair of texture coordinates.\n\nThe vertex is the building block of drawing. Everything which\nis visible on screen is made of vertices. They are grouped\nas 2D primitives (triangles, quads, ...), and these primitives\nare grouped to create even more complex 2D entities such as\nsprites, texts, etc.\n\nIf you use the graphical entities of SFML (sprite, text, shape)\nyou won't have to deal with vertices directly. But if you want\nto define your own 2D entities, such as tiled maps or particle\nsystems, using vertices will allow you to get maximum performances.\n\nExample:\n```\n# define a 100x100 square, red, with a 10x10 texture mapped on it\nvertices = [\n  SF::Vertex.new(SF.vector2f(  0,   0), SF::Color::Red, SF.vector2f( 0,  0)),\n  SF::Vertex.new(SF.vector2f(  0, 100), SF::Color::Red, SF.vector2f( 0,

it\nwindow.draw(vertices, SF::Quads)\n```\n\nNote: although texture coordinates are supposed to be an integer\namount of pixels, their type is float because of some buggy graphics\ndrivers that are

By using a\n`SF::VertexBuffer`, data that has not been changed between frames\ndoes not have to be re-transferred from system to graphics\nmemory as would be the case with `SF::VertexArray`. If data transfer\nis a bottleneck, this can lead to performance gains.\n\nUsing `SF::VertexBuffer`, the user also has the ability to only modify\na portion of the buffer in graphics memory. This way, a large buffer\ncan be allocated at the start of the application and only the\napplicable portions of it need to be updated during the course of\nthe application. This allows the user to take full control of data\ntransfers between system and graphics memory if they need to.\n\nIn special cases, the user can make use of multiple threads to update\nvertex data in multiple distinct regions of the buffer simultaneously.\nThis might make sense when e.g. the position of multiple objects has to\nbe recalculated very frequently. The computation load can be spread\nacross multiple threads as long as there are no other data dependencies.\n\nSimultaneous updates to the vertex buffer are not guaranteed to be\ncarried out by the driver in any specific order. Updating the same\nregion of the buffer from multiple threads will not cause undefined\nbehaviour, however the final state of the buffer will be unpredictable.\n\nSimultaneous updates of distinct non-overlapping regions of the buffer\nare also not guaranteed to complete in a specific order. However, in\nthis case the user can make sure to synchronize the writer threads at\nwell-defined points in their code. The driver will make sure that all\npending data transfers complete before the vertex buffer is sourced\nby the rendering pipeline.\n\nIt inherits `SF::Drawable`, but unlike other drawables it\nis not transformable.\n\nExample:\n```c++\nsf::Vertex vertices[15];\n...\nsf::VertexBuffer triangles(sf::Triangles);\ntriangles.create(15);\ntriangles.update(vertices);\n...\nwindow.draw(triangles);\n```\n\n*See also:* `SF::Vertex`, `SF::VertexArray`","summary":"<p>Vertex buffer storage for one or more 2D primitives</p>","class_methods":[{"id":"available?:Bool-class-method","html_id":"available?:Bool-class-method","name":"available?","doc":"Tell whether or not the system supports vertex buffers\n\nThis function should always be called before using\nthe vertex buffer features.
